### Noticable Changes/Improvements

The original Jekyll-based Spectral theme has a mobile-style menu button, even on desktop browsers. Personally, I
like to minimize the amount of clicking clients have to do, so I made the navigation bar adapt to the viewport
width. For example, on mobile devices, the default mobile-style menu button will show. On the desktop, a full
navigation bar will display.
